## Code
The code contained in this repository is organized as follows:
1. Create a multimodal (snRNA+snATAC) map of gene regulation in islets
    1. Process and clean data from 10x Multiome assays from 28 non-diabetic donors
    2.  Predict cRE-target gene links in six common cell types
3. Test for associations between four phenotypes (age, BMI, HbA1c, and sex) and components of gene regulation
4. Test for associations between genotype and chromatin accessibility (caQTLs)
5. Compare all our findings to known disease risk signals
