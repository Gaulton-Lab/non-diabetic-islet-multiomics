1. Notebook for comparing the enrichment of GWAS credible sets in sets of phenotype- and genotype-associated cREs: `1_caQTL_FINRICH.ipynb`
2. Notebook for performing statistical colocalization between cell type caQTLs and GWAS summary statistics: `2_matrixQTL_caQTL_GWAS_Coloc_all_celltypes.ipynb`
3. Notebook for summarizing colocalization results, adding supplementary information to those results and make a basic plot comparing summary statistics: `3_matrixQTL_caQTL_GWAS_Coloc_all_celltypes_ppH4_res.ipynb`
